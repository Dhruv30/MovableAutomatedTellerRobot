# ATM-project

The Final Project for MTE 100.
This project required us to create a solution to an existing problem using a Lego EV3 kit and Tetrix.
Our creation was a mobile ATM that could facilitate daily banking needs at a local branch.
The primary targets were the elderly and disabled who are incapable of standing up
for long moments at a time. Instead of forcing these people to stand up at an ATM,
the ATM would come to them.

Using Lego's variant of C called RobotC, this robot was coded so that it could
deposit and withdraw money through colour organization. Furthermore,
the robot had security functions that included a code that is input
using a rotating number dial, three password attempts and a card-specific
bank account.
